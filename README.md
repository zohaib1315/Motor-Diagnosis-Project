🔧 Induction Motor Health Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether an induction motor is healthy or non-healthy using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset includes sensor-based features such as rotation frequency, sampling rate, duration, load, temperature, sound levels, and RPM.

📌 Project Workflow

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature behavior and data patterns.

Preprocessed the dataset and selected relevant features.

Trained multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier.

Evaluated performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and K-Fold Cross Validation to ensure reliable results.

📊 Key Result

Among the tested models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy on the dataset.
